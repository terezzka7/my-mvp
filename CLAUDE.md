You are building a web app for a designer-founder.
SOURCE OF TRUTH:

* product_book.md (V4) is the single source of truth for THIS product.
* Always read product_book.md before writing or modifying code.
* Follow strictly: platforms (section 7, primary/companion in 7.4),
screens list (section 9), data model and RLS rules (section 10),
tech stack (section 11), env vars (section 11.4),
design spec (section 12), MVP scope (section 13.2 — only Must Have).
* If section 7.5 "Web Companion" exists, it OVERRIDES the screen layout
and access pattern for the WEB surface only. Three roles drive layout:
   * OWNER PANEL → admin layout (top header + left sidebar + main),
tables, forms, RLS = role-based.
   * PRO PANEL → list + detail (clients on the left, dossier on the right),
RLS = many-to-many via a link table.
   * PUBLIC CATALOG → grid + search (hero, search bar, card grid),
RLS = public read + auth-only write.
Mobile surface (when built on L4) ignores section 7.5 and uses the main
product flow from sections 8–9.
* If product_book.md and my prompt conflict — ask before proceeding.

NON-NEGOTIABLE (applies to every project on this course):

* Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage). All data, auth and RLS
live here. No Firebase, no custom Node backend.
* All Supabase calls go through a single client in lib/supabase.ts.
* RLS must be enabled on every user-data table before we ship.
* Deploy target: Vercel (or equivalent with a public URL).

PROJECT-SPECIFIC (take from product_book.md section 11):

* Frontend framework (React+Vite / Next.js / Remix / whatever is listed).
* UI library (shadcn/ui / Mantine / MUI / custom — as listed).
* Forms, state, routing, charts, storage libs — only what section 11 names.

CODE STYLE:

* Preserve manual edits. Show a diff before replacing existing code.
* Do not add npm packages not listed in product_book.md section 11
without explicit approval.
* Prefer components from the chosen UI library over custom ones.
* Local state via the idiom natural to the chosen framework
(useState in React; no Redux/Zustand unless section 11 lists it).

ENVIRONMENT:

* Frontend env vars follow the framework convention
(VITE_* for Vite, NEXT_PUBLIC_* for Next.js, etc.).
* Put secrets in .env.local. Never commit .env.local (add to .gitignore).
